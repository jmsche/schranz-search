Cookbooks
=========

This section should contain in future a collection of recipes for common tasks.

Let us know via the issue tracker on our `Github Repository <https://github.com/schranz-search/schranz-search>`_.
if you have a recipe you would like to see here.

This can go over creating a basic search page in your favorite framework,
over modifying default settings of an Index, mapping data to a Model class
and over connecting Index updates to your favorite ``ORM`` or persistent layer.

* Create your own Adapter (WIP)
